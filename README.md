# Nullgram

**Nullgram** is a fully custom Telegram client built **from scratch in Flutter**, without any of the messy original Telegram code.  
The goal is to create a clean, modern, and performant alternative to the official app.

Currently, Nullgram is being developed **only for Android**.  
If the author ever gets an iPhone - iOS support *might* become a thing too.

## ❌ Why

The author doesn’t like what Telegram has become -  
bloated with **ads**, **Telegram Premium**, and all the **NFT-style scam nonsense**.

So instead of complaining, Nullgram is being built as a **clean and free alternative**,  
where the focus is on **simplicity, and functionality** - not monetization.

## 🚀 Features (in progress)
- Built with Flutter
